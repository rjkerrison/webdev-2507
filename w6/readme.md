# Project 2

In groups of two or three, you'll be building a REST API.

While we're building and testing our REST API,
we'll build up a lot of requests in Postman.
The good news is that we can use Postman to create
quality documentation for our API.

## Requirements

Our REST APIs will

- allow for users to sign up and log in
- have at least two models
- have at least one model relationship
- use all of the CRUD operations at least once

You may also need a seeding script, depending on your project.
