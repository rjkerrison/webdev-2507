# Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design is all about making one webpage which responds to the user agent to give users the best style.

The main concept is around changing layout based on viewport width. Narrow screens will have a column layout; wider screens may be horizontal, or have even more complicated layouts.

## Mobile-first principle

The **mobile-first principle** is about structuring our HTML and our CSS with the idea that narrow screens — like those on mobile — are favoured. There are two reasons with _mobile-first_ is the industry standard:

1. most web traffic is now on mobile devices
2. mobile layouts are simpler than wider layouts

If we start with the basic vertical layouts for mobile, we can add additional styles for larger screens by using _media queries_.
