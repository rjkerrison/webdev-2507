# Transitions and Animations

CSS Transitions and Animations break down into a few ideas:

- changing state (hover, class changes)
- transformations
- transitions
- animations

Transitions can apply when we hover over an element, or (by using JS which we'll see [next week](../../../w2/d1/)) when an element's class changes.

**Animations** apply all the time. If we have a spinner, it's an animation. If we have a slide-in, a fade, like in a presentation, that's a **transition**.
