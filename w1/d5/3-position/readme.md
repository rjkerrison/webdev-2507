# Position

CSS _position_ is all about making small adjustments to an element's position, fixing things to the page, or setting them near the edge of their container.

The CSS properties break down to:

- `position: static;`, the default
- `position: relative;`, creates a new positioning context, can adjust an element's position relative to its ordinary static position
- `position: absolute;`, positions an element absolutely within its positioning context
- `position: fixed;`, positions an element like a fly on the windscreen, as if it's stuck on the screen and it will not move
- `position: sticky;`, like fixed, but only while it's the nearest — try it out!
