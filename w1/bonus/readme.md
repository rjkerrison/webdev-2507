# Bonus Exercise

From the template provided, and using what we've learnt this week about:

- strings
- functions
- conditional flows

Can you extend the code provided into a game that meets the description?

## Game Description

Run the starter code: it will ask you to guess a word.

The starter code also chooses a random word from a list.

Your game should tell the user how close they were to the random word

- if they got a letter right in the right position, tell them
- if they got a letter right but in the wrong position, tell them that
- if they got everything right, tell them they won and exit
- BONUS: if they didn't make a valid guess (5 letters long) tell them and let them try again
- BONUS: only allow guesses which are in the word list
- BONUS: How would you allow them to guess multiple times?
