# Day 4: Grids and Grid Movement

Grids, movement on grids, and detection of collisions on grids are a major concept to understand how data can help us build applications or games.

Florian showed a big example, find this at [./grid-movement](./grid-movement).

Robin made a tiny one, find this at [./0-basic-grid](./0-basic-grid).
