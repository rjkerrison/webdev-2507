There's always more to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Canvas

Canvas is great. It allows for creating animations with HTML and JavaScript, directly in the browser. This makes it very powerful for interactive elements, such as games or infographics.

It is largely a replacement for Flash, which required proprietary software to develop, and proprietary licences to run. Canvas is part of the HTML5 specification, and thus part of the open web standard. We create our canvas drawings and animations as code, making them much easier to share, modify, and version.

## Audio

Adding audio to your pages, especially games, elevates the user experience.

- [HTML5 audio: Beware of the Raptors](https://rjkerrison.co.uk/textbook/audio/raptors/index.html), learn the absolute basics of audio in the browser
- [HTML5 Audio with controls](https://rjkerrison.co.uk/textbook/audio/controls/index.html) is a guide about how to use built-in controllers and create your own custom controls
