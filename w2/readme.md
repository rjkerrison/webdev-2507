# Week 2: Building Applications

Week 2 is all about bringing it all together: JavaScript and the DOM.

We've seen HTML, we've seen CSS, and we've made good friends with JavaScript.

In week 2, we'll invite them all over for a stylish soir√©e, and they can finally meet.

Florian will be leading this week, and updating resources as we go.

- [Day 1: DOM Manipulation](./d1)
- [Day 2: Object-Oriented Programming](./d2)
- [Day 3: Timing](./d3)
- [Day 4: Grid Movement](./d4)
- Day 5: Project Kickoff
