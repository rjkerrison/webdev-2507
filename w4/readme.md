# Week 4: Serving Data

This week, we'll see how the sausage gets made. We're looking at servers, how we talk to them, how we build them, and why they matter in the web.

1. [Basic HTTP server in node](./d1/1-node-http-server/server.js)
2. [Using JSON to store data](d1/2-data/data.js)
3. [Weather API with Fetch](https://codepen.io/rjkerrison/pen/GRQxKyy)
