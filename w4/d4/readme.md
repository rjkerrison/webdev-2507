# Week 4 Day 4: Mongoose

Today, we are going to view the destructuring syxntax and then see how to use mongoose to:

- Connect to the Database
- Create Schema, Model and collection

1. [Destructuring](./destructuring.md)
2. [Mongoose](./1-mongoose-intro/readme.md)

We'll complete the [Mongoose recipes lab][lab] in the afternoon.
